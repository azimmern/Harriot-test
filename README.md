# Harriot Test
This is a IIIF Training Workbench designed to host test-materials (including Images, Manifests, Annotations, Collections) and an Image Viewer (Mirador, enhanced with MathJax) on index.html. 

Our goal is to showcase Thomas Harriot's manuscripts as IIIF manifests and enable annotations that use MathJax to translate LaTeX into HTML.
